# Building Systems With The ChatGPT API

Welcome to the **Building Systems With The ChatGPT API** course repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the course taught by Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford.

## About This Project

In this course, you will learn how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model. Unlock new development capabilities and improve your efficiency with this brand new short course.

### What Youâ€™ll Build:
1. **Chains of Prompts**: Interact with the completions of prior prompts.
2. **Systems Integration**: Use Python code to interact with both completions and new prompts.
3. **Customer Service Chatbot**: Combine all techniques from this course to build a functional chatbot.

### Skills You'll Learn:
- **Classifying User Queries**: Route user queries to the appropriate chat agent response.
- **Evaluating Query Safety**: Ensure user queries are safe and appropriate.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Process tasks through multi-step reasoning.

## Course Details

This one-hour course builds on the lessons from the popular **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers** (though it is not a prerequisite). Hands-on examples make each concept easy to understand, and built-in Jupyter notebooks allow you to seamlessly experiment with the code and prompts presented in the course.

### Instructors:
- **Isa Fulford** (OpenAI)
- **Andrew Ng** (DeepLearning.AI)
